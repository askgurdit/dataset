The museum also features a diverse range of ancient coins, inscriptions, and manuscripts that shed light on the region's rich past. In addition to its archaeological and historical collections, the museum displays artifacts related to the city’s industrial history, which became a hub for textiles and other manufacturing industries during the British era. The museum also features exhibits on the 1857 First War of Indian Independence, which has deep historical significance for Kanpur, as the city was a key center during the uprising. The museum's collection of colonial-era artifacts includes items from the time of British rule, providing valuable insights into the city's role during the colonial period. Another section of the museum is dedicated to local folklore, showcasing the cultural traditions of Kanpur and its surrounding areas, including folk art, handicrafts, and textiles.
